Jingwei is a MQTT-powered notification system for original Google Glass. The
application is listening to the defined topics and then, when a new message is
received, it shows their content on the device screen.

Tap the DPad to connect to MQTT broker, slide down to disconnect. Slide down
again to return to Glass main screen.

The PowerPoint Add-In is sending the MQTT notifications when a new slide during
a slideshow is displayed, with a notes attached to the slide, essentially
allowing showing you PowerPoint slide notes on your Glass during the
presentation.
